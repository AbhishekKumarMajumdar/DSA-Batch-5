# Variable Sized Array Problem

## Problem Statement

You are given `n` variable-length arrays and `q` queries. Each query asks you to retrieve an element from one of the arrays.

## Input Format

1. The first line contains two space-separated integers `n` and `q`:
   - `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5): the number of variable-length arrays.
   - `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5): the number of queries.

2. The next `n` lines each describe an array:
   - The first integer of each line is `k`, the number of elements in the array.
   - The next `k` integers are the elements of the array.

3. The next `q` lines each describe a query:
   - Each line contains two space-separated integers `i` and `j`:
     - `i` (0 ≤ i < n): the index of the array.
     - `j` (0 ≤ j < k): the index of the element within the array referenced by `i`.

## Output Format

For each query, print the element located at index `j` of the array referenced by `i`. There should be a total of `q` lines of output.

## Sample Input

```
2 2
3 1 5 4
5 1 2 8 9 3
0 1
1 3
```

## Sample Output

```
5
9
```

## Explanation

In the sample input:
- There are 2 arrays:
  1. The first array has 3 elements: [1, 5, 4]
  2. The second array has 5 elements: [1, 2, 8, 9, 3]

- There are 2 queries:
  1. Query (0, 1): Retrieve the element at index 1 of the first array, which is 5.
  2. Query (1, 3): Retrieve the element at index 3 of the second array, which is 9.
