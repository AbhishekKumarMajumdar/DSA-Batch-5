# String Manipulation Problem

## Problem Statement

given two strings, `a` and `b`. our task is to perform the following operations and print the results:

1. Print the lengths of both strings.
2. Print the concatenation of the two strings.
3. Swap the first characters of both strings and print the modified strings.

## Input Format

- The first line contains the string `a`.
- The second line contains the string `b`.

## Output Format

1. Print two space-separated integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` on the first line.
2. Print the concatenated string `a + b` on the second line.
3. Print the two modified strings (with their first characters swapped) separated by a space on the third line.

## Sample Input

```
abcd
ef
```

## Sample Output

```
4 2
abcdef
ebcd af
```

## Explanation

Given the input strings:
- `a` = "abcd"
- `b` = "ef"

1. The lengths of `a` and `b` are 4 and 2, respectively.
2. The concatenation of `a` and `b` is "abcdef".
3. After swapping the first characters of `a` and `b`, the strings become "ebcd" and "af".
