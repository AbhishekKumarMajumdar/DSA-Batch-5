# Flowerbed Problem

## Problem Statement

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots. Given an array `flowerbed` containing `0`s and `1`s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and a number `n`, return if `n` new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

## Example

### Example 1

int[] flowerbed = {1, 0, 0, 0, 1};
int n = 1;
bool result = canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n);  // Output: true
```

### Example 2

int[] flowerbed = {1, 0, 0, 0, 1};
int n = 2;
bool result = canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n);  // Output: false
```

## Constraints

- The input array `flowerbed` will contain at most 20000 elements.
- `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- There are no two adjacent `1`s in the `flowerbed` array.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`
